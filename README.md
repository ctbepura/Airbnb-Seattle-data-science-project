# Udacity_the-data-science-process
My first submission for the Udacity Data science nanodegree assignment 1

**General overview and Motivation:** This project analyses the Seattle Airbnb data with the purpose of answering the following three questions.
1. Does the number of amenities (e.g. heating, TV, wireless internet, washer, dryer etc) affect demand for 1 bed room types (as shown by availability). Is it worth investing in a lot of amenities to boost demand for a 1 bed?

2. Do hosts categorised as superhosts generally receive higher review scores than hosts that are not superhosts?

3. How well can we predict price using the data that we have?

The purpose is to help new and existing hosts understand how some of the findings of this project can help them in making decisions around investing in amenities like wi-fi, television, pet-friendly set up, and other such amenities affect demand for their listings.

Guests can also benefit from this data as they can understand how being hosted by a host classified as a superhost can impact their experience based on historic review scores of superhosts versus non-superhosts.

Finally both hosts and guests can benefit in understanding the predictability of price. This can be used to guide the timing of travel of anticipate less costly periods to travel, or when high returns can be expected for the hosts.

The data analysis of this project was done on Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda 3) using Python 3 prohramming language.

**Installation:** There should be no additional installation required other than the standard python libraries to run this project

**Licensing and Acknowledgements:** There are no restrictions to the citing of this analysis, however, giving credit to the owner of this data will be appreciated. I would like to thank Kaggle and Airbnb for providing access to the dataset that I used.  https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data. Also special thanks to the Udacity team for all the help with my first data science / python project.
